Quantum Diffraction Lab - User Guide
📋 What Is This?
The Quantum Diffraction Lab is an interactive physics simulator that shows how light behaves when it passes through narrow openings (slits). It demonstrates one of the most famous experiments in physics - the double-slit experiment that helped prove light behaves like both a wave and a particle.

🎯 What You Can See
This simulator shows:

Single-Slit Diffraction: How light spreads out when passing through one narrow opening
Double-Slit Diffraction: The famous quantum mechanics experiment showing beautiful interference patterns
Real-time Patterns: Watch how changing values instantly affects the light pattern


🔬 The Science Behind It
Single-Slit Diffraction
When light passes through a single narrow opening, it doesn't just go straight through - it spreads out and creates a pattern with:

A bright center spot
Dimmer spots on either side
Dark areas in between

Double-Slit Diffraction
When light passes through two narrow openings close together:

The light waves from both slits overlap and interfere
This creates many bright and dark bands (called fringes)
The pattern proves light behaves like waves
This is one of the most important experiments in quantum physics!


✨ Main Features
🎚️ Adjustable Settings
Wavelength (λ)

Controls the color of light
Smaller values = blue/violet light
Larger values = red/orange light
Typical range: 400-700 nanometers (visible light)

Slit Width (a)

How wide the opening is
Narrower slits create wider patterns
Wider slits create tighter patterns
Typical range: 0.01-1 millimeter

Slit Separation (d) - For double-slit only

Distance between the two openings
Affects how close together the interference fringes are
Typical range: 0.1-1 millimeter

Max Intensity (I₀)

Compare: Try different wavelengths to see color effects
Experiment: Change one parameter at a time to see its effect
Use Grid: Turn on grid for precise measurements


❓ Common Questions
Why does the pattern spread out more with smaller slits?
Smaller openings cause more wave spreading (diffraction). It's like water waves going through a narrow gap.
What makes the dark spots in double-slit?
The waves from both slits cancel each other out at certain angles - this is called destructive interference.
Why are the numbers so small?
Light waves are incredibly tiny! We use scientific notation: 5e-7 means 0.0000005 meters.
Can I see this in real life?
Yes! You can do this experiment with a laser pointer and thin slits cut in aluminum foil.
